#Project Title: 
Supermarket Performance Analytics Dashboard (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

#Project Description:
This project analyzes a supermarket’s store data to discover sales trends, top-performing stores, and customer efficiency. 
It uses Python libraries such as Pandas for data cleaning and analysis, NumPy for numerical calculations, and Matplotlib for visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains sales information for multiple stores, including:
- Store ID
- Store Area (sq. ft.)
- Items Available
- Daily Customer Count
- Store Sales

## Features / Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values and duplicates)
2. Calculated key metrics:
   - Sales per Customer
   - Sales per Area
3. Identified top 5 and bottom 5 performing stores
4. Analyzed correlations between:
   - Store area & sales
   - Customer count & sales
5. Visualized insights using:
   - Bar charts for sales per store
   - Scatter plots for customer vs sales
   - Histograms for sales efficiency
   - Subplots dashboard combining all charts
6. Exported a cleaned summary CSV with all metrics

## Key Insights
- Larger stores and stores with more customers generally have higher sales
- Some smaller stores achieve high efficiency per area or per customer
- The dashboard visualizations clearly show top-performing and underperforming stores

## Visualizations
- Bar chart: Total sales per store  
- Scatter plot: Customers vs Sales  
- Histogram: Sales per Customer  
- Subplots dashboard showing all insights together

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pycharm
